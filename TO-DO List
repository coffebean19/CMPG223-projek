It is recommended to use a console app to test code, as
the code must portable enough to use in a GUI application

[]!  Execute Reader function needs to be finished;      
[]!  More overloading constructers for differing cases;
[]  Write exception handling in all functions that have not yet;
[]!  In ReadFromStocks the decimal value converts the '.' in a number to ','
        e.g. 5.6 becomes '5,6'. This in turn leads to errors in the sql
        query. Current fix is making it a string parameter, but keeping the
        decimal would prevent future troubles. Needs a workaround
