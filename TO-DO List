#---///-----TO-DO List-----///---#

//Code legend:
- x     = done;

- N:    = Note;

//---DbConnection.cs---//

It is recommended to use a console app to test code, as
the code must portable enough to use in a GUI application

[]  Execute Reader function needs to be finished;      
[]  More overloading constructers for differing cases;
[]  Overloading CRUD funcitons for the database  N: Specific functions that needs this will be added later;
[]  Updating TO-DO List;
[]  Write exception handling in all functions that have not yet;
[x] Read functions for employee table;
[x] Read functions for orders table;
[o] Read functions for stocks table;
[]  Read functions for rights table;
[]  Read functions for transactions table;
[]  Read functions for transactions_details table;
[]  In ReadFromStocks the decimal value converts the '.' in a number to ','
        e.g. 5.6 becomes '5,6'. This in turn leads to errors in the sql
        query. Current fix is making it a string parameter, but keeping the
        decimal would prevent future troubles. Needs a workaround
